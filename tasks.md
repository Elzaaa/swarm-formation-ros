# To-Do: Swarm Navigation with Formation Control

## Done

- [x] Set up Docker environment (build/run)
- [x] Create `my_node` (publisher)
- [x] Create `listener_node` (subscriber)
- [x] Unified launch file for both nodes

## Next steps

- [ ] Add basic movement control (e.g., publish to `/cmd_vel`)
- [ ] Implement simple formation logic (e.g., V-shape, line)
- [ ] Integrate RViz for visualization
- [ ] Prepare a demo with 3 robots in formation
